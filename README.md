# 👋 Hi, I'm Lisa Thurairasu
## Senior Data Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Cloud & Big Data Expert

## 🎉 About Me
I am a **Data Scientist III** with over 12 years of experience in the **banking and healthcare** industries. I specialize in **data science, advanced analytics, machine learning, cloud computing (Microsft Azure on Databricks), and big data technologies**. I have a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Life Sciences from McMaster University and a Master of Science (MSc) in Community and Population Health Science (also known as Epidemiology) with courses in Biostatistics, Biostatistical Methods, Applied Statistical Methods, and Epidemiology. In addition, I have a Machine Learning Software Foundations Certificate from the University of Toronto.

I am passionate about **machine learning, automation, streamlining processes, and data-driven decision-making.**

- Saskatchewan Population Health and Evaluation Research Unit (SPHERU) (1.5 years)

### **🎓 Certifications I have obtained:**
- Supervised Machine Learning: Regression (Coursera)
- Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning (Coursera)
- SAS SQL Essentials (SAS)
- SAS Programming Essentials (SAS)

### **📝 Models I have built:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees (DT)
- Random Forests (RF)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Networks including Forward Feed Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

I have also created production pipelines to organize, streamline, and scale processing.

## 🔥 Featured Projects
### Here are some of my key projects:

### **1) [UofT Machine Learning Team Project](https://github.com/Retail_Sales)**
A team project as part of the University of Toronto Machine Learning Software Foundation Certificate which consisted of analyzing a retail dataset and applying machine learning models to predict a customer's product category purchase. A XGBoost model and a Forward Feed Neural Network model were developed.

### **2) [Credit Datamart Base Tables](https://github.com/work)**
I developed base tables for a credit datamart in which multiples tables containing primary and foreign keys were joined. Each table was created based on a theme and the frequency of joins used in various reports.


## 🚀 How to Use My Projects
#### Most of my projects contain:
- **README files** with setup instructions
- **Code notebooks** or easy execution
- **Data (if applicable) or simulated datasets**
- **Visualization in Python**
