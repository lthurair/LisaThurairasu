# 👋 Hi, I'm Lisa Thurairasu
## Senior Data Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Cloud & Big Data Expert

### 🎉 About Me:
I am a **Data Scientist III** with over 12 years of experience in the **banking and healthcare** industries. I specialize in **data science, advanced analytics, machine learning, cloud computing (Microsft Azure on Databricks), and big data technologies**. I have a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Life Sciences from McMaster University and a Master of Science (MSc) in Community and Population Health Science (also known as Epidemiology) with courses in Biostatistics, Biostatistical Methods, Applied Statistical Methods, and Epidemiology. In addition, I have a Machine Learning Software Foundations Certificate from the University of Toronto.

I am passionate about **machine learning, automation, streamlining processes, and data-driven decision-making.**

###📝 Skilled in:
**Programming Languages:**
 🔹 **Python (libraries include scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, scala, plotly, matplotlib, numpy, pandas)**
 🔹 **SQL (includes MySQL, NoSQL, SQLite)**
 🔹 **Spark (PySpark and SparkSQL)**
 🔹 **SAS**
 🔹 **SPSS**
**Tools and Technology:**
🔹 **Azure on Databricks**
🔹 **Jupyter Notebook**
🔹 **Hadoop**
🔹 **Data visualization such as Tableau, Matplotlib in Python, and PowerBI**

### **🏢 Companies I have worked with include:**
- TD Bank (over 8 years)
- Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (2.5 years)

## 🔥 Featured Projects - Here are some of my key projects:

### **[UofT Machine Learning Team Project](https://github.com/Retail_Sales)**
A team project as part of the University of Toronto Machine Learning Software Foundation Certificate which consisted of analyzing a retail dataset and applying machine learning models to predict a customer's product category purchase. A XGBoost model and a Forward Feed Neural Network model were developed.

## 🚀 How to Use My Projects - Most of my projects contain:
- **README files** with setup instructions
- **Code notebooks** or easy execution
- **Data (if applicable) or simulated datasets**
- **Visualization in Python**

To get started, check the **ReadMe.md** in each project repository.
