## &#128293 Featured Projects - Here are some of my key projects:

### **[UofT Machine Learning Team Project](https://github.com/Retail_Sales)**
A team project as part of the University of Toronto Machine Learning Software Foundation Certificate which consisted of analyzing a retail dataset and applying machine learning models to predict a customer's product category purchase. A XGBoost model and a Forward Feed Neural Network model were developed.

## How to Use My Projects - Most of my projects contain:
- **README files** with setup instructions
- **Code notebooks* or easy execution
- **Data (if applicable) or simulated datasets**
- **Visualization in Python**

To get started, check the **README.md** in each project repository.
